# Wardrobe Inventory
A .NET project designed to demonstrate building a Blazor WebAssembly application with Entity Framework Core and a focus on pure C# development.

## Requirements
- [ ] This is an application where you should store and retrieve wardrobe data..
- [ ] You should use a Blazor Webassembly project.
- [ ] You can choose whatever database solution you want: Sqlite, SQL server or whatever you're comfortable with.
- [ ] Since we'll only have basic CRUD operations, you should use Entity Framework.
- [ ] Your database should have a single table. The objective is to focus on learning Blazor, so we should avoid the complexities of relational data.
- [ ] Users of your app need to be able to upload pictures of wardrobe items.
- [ ] You CAN'T USE Javascript interop. The objective is to stay away from JS, even though it's still possible to use it.
